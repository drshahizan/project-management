# Lab 2: Applying Agile Project Management Principles - Case Study on Developing Malaysia's MyGOV Mobile App

### Case Study Background

The **MyGOV Mobile App** is a digital platform initiated by the Malaysian government to provide citizens with a single access point for government services. The app was designed to offer features such as accessing personal tax information, renewing vehicle licenses, and checking COVID-19 updates, allowing Malaysian citizens to engage with essential services seamlessly and efficiently. Given the complexity of the project and the need for continuous improvements based on user feedback, the development team adopted Agile Project Management Principles.

This lab exercise will guide you through a simulated Agile process for developing the MyGOV Mobile App. Each step will represent a phase in Agile project management, incorporating various Agile principles.

### **Lab Exercise Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Project Vision and Scope Definition**

1. **Objective:** Define the project's vision and scope, understanding the key objectives and stakeholder needs.
2. **Tasks:**
   - Identify the app’s main goal (e.g., “To create a unified digital platform for easy access to government services”).
   - Define the core features: login portal, services directory, secure transactions, and notifications.
   - Determine key stakeholders: Malaysian citizens, government agencies, IT security experts, and customer support.
3. **Outcome:** Write a short paragraph describing the project's vision and scope.

**Example Outcome:**  
*The MyGOV Mobile App aims to provide a centralized platform where Malaysian citizens can access government services conveniently and securely. Core features include secure logins, access to personal tax information, license renewals, and real-time notifications for government updates. The app will be developed to ensure data privacy, ease of use, and scalability.*

#### **Step 2: Create the Product Backlog**

1. **Objective:** Develop a product backlog by listing all required features and functionalities.
2. **Tasks:**
   - Break down the app’s features into user stories (e.g., “As a user, I want to check my tax information so I can stay updated on my financial obligations”).
   - Prioritize the features based on importance and user needs.
   - Ensure security features like two-factor authentication and encrypted data storage are included.
3. **Outcome:** Create a list of prioritized user stories for the product backlog.

**Example Outcome:**  
**Product Backlog:**
   - User Authentication: “As a user, I want to log in securely to access my information.”
   - Tax Information Access: “As a user, I want to view my tax information securely.”
   - License Renewal: “As a user, I want to renew my vehicle license easily.”
   - Notifications: “As a user, I want to receive real-time updates on government announcements.”
   - Security Features: “As a user, I want my data to be securely encrypted.”

---

#### **Step 3: Plan the First Sprint**

1. **Objective:** Define the tasks to be completed in the first sprint, focusing on developing essential app features.
2. **Tasks:**
   - Select the highest-priority items from the product backlog to include in Sprint 1.
   - Break down each user story into specific tasks (e.g., create login page, implement encryption for user data).
   - Set a time frame for Sprint 1 (e.g., two weeks).
3. **Outcome:** Create a Sprint Backlog for Sprint 1.

**Example Outcome:**  
**Sprint 1 Backlog:**
   - Design and implement the login page.
   - Set up database integration for storing user information securely.
   - Implement two-factor authentication.
   - Develop the tax information access feature.
   - Create a basic notification system.

---

#### **Step 4: Daily Stand-up Meetings**

1. **Objective:** Conduct daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
2. **Tasks:**
   - Each team member shares what they worked on, what they will work on next, and any obstacles they face.
   - Record any blockers and assign team members to address them.
3. **Outcome:** Practice communication and collaboration, essential for Agile teams.

**Example Outcome:**  
*Team Member A: “Yesterday, I completed the login page. Today, I will work on integrating two-factor authentication. I need help from the database team to store authentication data.”*

*Team Member B: “I am working on the tax information access feature. I need feedback from the security team on data encryption requirements.”*

---

#### **Step 5: Sprint Review**

1. **Objective:** Review the completed tasks and demonstrate the working features to stakeholders.
2. **Tasks:**
   - Present completed features, such as the login page and tax information access, to the stakeholders.
   - Gather feedback on functionality, design, and user experience.
   - Document any changes or additional features requested by stakeholders.
3. **Outcome:** Stakeholder feedback for future improvements and adjustments to the backlog.

**Example Outcome:**  
*Feedback: Stakeholders are satisfied with the login page and security features. They suggest adding a “Forgot Password” feature to improve user accessibility.*

---

#### **Step 6: Sprint Retrospective**

1. **Objective:** Reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and areas for improvement.
2. **Tasks:**
   - Discuss successes, such as the smooth development of the login feature.
   - Identify challenges, like difficulties in integrating the database with the tax information feature.
   - Propose changes for the next sprint, such as better documentation for security protocols.
3. **Outcome:** Actionable insights for improving the process in future sprints.

**Example Outcome:**  
*Successes: The team completed all planned tasks within the sprint. Communication in daily stand-ups was effective.*

*Challenges: Integrating security protocols took more time than expected. Next sprint, we will allocate more time to security requirements.*

*Improvements: Add more detailed documentation for each security-related task.*

---

#### **Step 7: Update the Product Backlog and Plan Sprint 2**

1. **Objective:** Adjust the product backlog based on feedback and plan the next sprint.
2. **Tasks:**
   - Add new features or improvements based on Sprint 1 feedback (e.g., add “Forgot Password” functionality).
   - Re-prioritize user stories as needed, ensuring high-impact features are planned for Sprint 2.
   - Create a new Sprint Backlog for Sprint 2.
3. **Outcome:** Updated product backlog and Sprint Backlog for Sprint 2.

**Example Outcome:**  
**Updated Product Backlog:**
   - High Priority: “Forgot Password” feature, secure data encryption for all user information.
   - Medium Priority: Improvements to the notification system, multi-language support.

**Sprint 2 Backlog:**
   - Develop and test “Forgot Password” functionality.
   - Enhance security for tax information data.
   - Implement notification system improvements.
