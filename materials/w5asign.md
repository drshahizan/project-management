# Case Study 1: Exercise: Applying Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)

**Objective:**  
Gain hands-on experience with the DSDM framework by applying its principles to solve a real-world IT project scenario set in Malaysia. This exercise will deepen your understanding of DSDM’s practical applications, especially in environments that require a high degree of flexibility and responsiveness to change.

## **Instructions**

**Group Size:**  
- Work in **pairs** (groups of two) to encourage collaboration and the exchange of ideas. This will help simulate real-world team dynamics in IT project management.

**Timeline:**  
- Complete the exercise within **one week**, allowing enough time to explore each task thoroughly. This includes preparing a detailed class presentation and an in-depth discussion to share your findings and insights.

## **Case Study:**  
**Title:** **Enhancing e-Government Services in Malaysia Using DSDM**

The Malaysian government is looking to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of its e-Government services, such as MySejahtera, MyEG, and e-Khidmat. The goal is to create a centralized mobile application that unifies various government services, offering a seamless user experience. 

This project is essential for improving public access to digital services and ensuring they meet the evolving needs of citizens. Given the tight timeline and frequent policy updates, the DSDM approach—with its emphasis on iterative development and stakeholder collaboration—is an ideal framework for this initiative. By leveraging DSDM’s principles, the project can balance speed, adaptability, and quality to deliver a robust solution.



## **Exercise Tasks**

### **1. Understanding DSDM Principles**  
- Study the core **DSDM philosophy** and its **eight guiding principles**. Dive deeper into the methodology to explain how each principle contributes to the success of IT projects under rapidly changing conditions, as seen in the case study. Discuss specific examples of these principles in action, such as prioritizing business needs and enabling collaborative decision-making. Evaluate how these principles ensure alignment between project goals and stakeholder expectations while adapting to policy changes and tight deadlines.
- Write a detailed summary connecting DSDM principles to the objectives of this project, highlighting specific scenarios where these principles would be most beneficial.

### **2. DSDM Project Life Cycle (15 Marks)**  
- Break down the project into the **four stages of the DSDM life cycle**, providing a comprehensive overview of each stage:  
  - **Feasibility Study:** Define the project’s objectives and determine its scope. Include considerations such as user demographics, government regulations, and technical feasibility.  
  - **Business Study:** Conduct a thorough analysis of stakeholders’ needs and expectations. This includes identifying the key features and functionalities that would provide maximum value to the users.
  - **Iterative Development:** Propose features for iterative development, such as real-time payment integration, e-document downloads, and user authentication via MyKad. Discuss the benefits of developing these features in short cycles and incorporating user feedback.
  - **Implementation:** Suggest strategies for deploying the app efficiently, such as phased rollouts, pilot testing, and training programs for end-users to ensure a smooth transition.

### **3. Requirements Prioritization (15 Marks)**  
- Apply the **MoSCoW prioritization** technique to classify requirements:  
  - **Must Have:** Integration with MyKad for secure login, ensuring compliance with national identity standards.  
  - **Should Have:** Support for multiple languages (Bahasa Malaysia, English, Mandarin) to cater to Malaysia’s diverse population.  
  - **Could Have:** A chatbot to handle FAQs, providing users with instant assistance.  
  - **Won’t Have:** Third-party app integrations (e.g., delivery services), as they fall outside the project’s primary scope.  
- Justify your prioritization choices by linking them to the project’s objectives and the needs of the end-users.

### **4. Managing Risks and Changes (10 Marks)**  
- Identify at least **two potential risks** for this project, such as data privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of personal information and regulatory changes that could impact project timelines.  
- Propose actionable strategies to mitigate these risks, such as implementing robust data encryption protocols and maintaining close communication with regulatory bodies to stay updated on policy changes.

### **5. Reflection on Agile Values (5 Marks)**  
- Reflect on how DSDM’s **collaborative and iterative nature** could address challenges unique to Malaysia, such as accommodating cultural diversity and varying levels of digital literacy among users. Provide examples of how stakeholder involvement and frequent reviews can ensure the project’s success in a diverse and dynamic environment.

### **Deliverables**  
   - Submit a detailed 4-5 page report covering all six tasks. The report should be well-organized, with sections for each task, and include relevant diagrams or tables where applicable.
